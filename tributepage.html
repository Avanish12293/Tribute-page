		<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who
			employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.
		</p>
		<p>Gandhi's philosophy and leadership inspired many civil rights and freedom movements across the world. He is
			also known for his advocacy of vegetarianism, simple living, and belief in the power of individual
			conscience.</p>
		<p>Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a Hindu nationalist angered by his vision of a secular India.</p>
		<div>Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early

			1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India.
			In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into
			two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus,
			Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially
			in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited
			the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook
			several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi
			on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay
			out some cash assets owed to Pakistan, which the Indian government had been resisting.
			Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that
			Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, spread
			among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse,
			a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India,
			who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an
			interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.</div>
